# Cronos

Node.js library to build server apps using react as live template **(Server Side Rendering)**

## Before install

Conekta packages are distributed by github registry. Check that your project has an `.npmrc` file with the following content:
```
//npm.pkg.github.com/:_authToken=${NPM_TOKEN}
@conekta:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com
```
`NPM_TOKEN` is a github personal access token. You can create one [here](https://github.com/settings/tokens) and enable `read:packages` permission, that will allow you to download `@conekta` scoped packages

## Installation
```bash
npm i @conekta/cronos
```
